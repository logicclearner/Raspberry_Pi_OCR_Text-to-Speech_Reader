# Raspberry_Pi_OCR_Text-to-Speech_Reader
A Python script that turns a Raspberry Pi into a text-reading device. It uses the Pi Camera and OpenCV to show a live feed. On a keypress, it captures an image, extracts text using Tesseract OCR, and reads it aloud with a text-to-speech engine. A simple assistive tech tool for the visually impaired.
